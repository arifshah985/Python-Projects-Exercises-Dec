        " Create an interactive 'Basic Math Quiz Game' that challenges users with randomly generated arithmetic questions (addition, subtraction, multiplication), evaluates their answers, tracks their score, and provides performance feedback upon completion. The game should be engaging and help users practice fundamental math skills.\n",
        "\n",
        " ##Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "Design the Game Flow (Question): How would you design the overall structure of a simple math quiz game? Consider: How many questions will there be? How will the game start and end? How will you keep track of the player's score throughout the game?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generate Math Questions (Question): To create a single math question, how would you generate two random numbers? How can you randomly select an arithmetic operator (like +, -, *)? Once you have the numbers and operator, how will you calculate the correct answer for that specific question?\n",
        "\n",
        "Handle User Input and Check Answer (Question): What programming constructs would you use to get the user's answer? Once you have their input, how will you compare it to the correct answer? What kind of feedback (e.g., 'Correct!' or 'Wrong!') should the game provide to the user based on their answer?\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement Scoring and Game Loop (Question): How will you implement a system to keep a running score? To repeat the process of generating a question, getting an answer, and checking it for a set number of rounds, what type of loop structure would you use?\n",
        "\n",
        "Display Final Results (Question): After all questions have been answered, how will you display the player's final score? What kind of conditional messages would you show them based on their performance (e.g., 'Great job!' for a high score, or 'Keep practicing!' for a lower score)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Final Task: Reflect on the complete logic you've designed for the Math Quiz Game. Which programming concepts (like functions, loops, conditionals, random numbers, input/output) were essential, and how did each contribute to building the game?\n",
